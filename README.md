# About

This is an eye controlled photo gallery! Close your eyes for a litle bit longer than a blink to advance to the next image.

### Features

- **Eye Gesture Control**: Advance to the next image by closing your eyes for a bit longer than a blink.
- **Facial Landmark Detection**: Uses facial landmarks and eye aspect ratio (EAR) to detect user input.
- **Accessible Navigation**: Designed to provide an alternative method of navigation and offer more accessibility to users.

# Usage

Run the following command: `python main.py [--verbose|-v]`

Verbose mode can be set by the '--verbose' or '-v' flag. This will display the camera feed and all of the facial landmarks, as well as numerical data.

To exit, press 'q' on the keyboard.

# Libraries Used

OpenCV, NumpPy, dlib

# Motivation and Next Steps

This project was a great exploration into facial landmark detection and gesture recognition. In the future, I'd love to support a variety of different gestures to continue to create accesible user experiences in a diverse array of applications and contexts.
